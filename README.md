Are you ready to take your child's language skills to the next level? Our AI-powered learning app, T.A.L.L, is here to help you unlock the power of communication.

**Why is tracing helpful in retaining information?** 
- *Fine Motor Skills Development:* Tracing requires precise hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. When children trace letters, they are honing their fine motor skills by using their fingers or a writing tool to follow the shapes.
- *Letter Recognition:* Tracing letters helps children become familiar with the shapes and forms of letters in the alphabet. By repeatedly tracing letters, they reinforce their ability to recognize and distinguish one letter from another.
- *Reinforcement of Vocabulary:* Tracing can be used not only for letters but also for words and phrases. Tracing the shape of words alongside their pronunciation can help children associate the written word with its spoken counterpart.

**T.A.L.L** was made with children with learning disabilities although it is equally useful for all children in mind it uses AI to teach children alphabets and numbers. T.A.L.L can also be customized to any language. It can also be adapted for older children by making them trace full words and not just alphabets.
